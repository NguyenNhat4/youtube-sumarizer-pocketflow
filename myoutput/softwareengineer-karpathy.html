</h2>
    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>Will kids learn different computer skills when AI helps write programs?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content">"<i>Software 3.0</i>" is like telling a super-smart robot chef what you want in simple English, instead of writing every tiny cooking step. So, in computer class, kids might learn less about writing exact code ("<i>Software 1.0</i>") and more about:
<ol>
    <li><b>Talking to AI:</b> Learning how to clearly tell smart computers what to do using everyday language.</li>
    <li><b>"Vibe Coding":</b> This means getting a computer to do cool things just by saying what you want, like magic! This makes it easier for everyone to be a programmer.</li>
</ol>
The focus shifts to guiding AI, not just writing every single instruction.
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What computer jobs will still need humans to write code?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content">Even if "<i>Software 3.0</i>" (smart AI) can do a lot, some things still need human touch.
<ol>
    <li><b>Supervising AI:</b> Just like a boss, humans need to check if the AI is doing things right. AI can make silly mistakes and "<i>hallucinate</i>."</li>
    <li><b>Building Tricky Parts:</b> For very special, super-precise tasks, humans will still write exact code ("<i>Software 1.0</i>") or fine-tune smart AI brains ("<i>Software 2.0</i>").</li>
    <li><b>Complex Setup:</b> Making programs work in the real world (like logging in or taking payments) still needs human experts, as this "<i>devops stuff</i>" is hard for AI agents to do perfectly yet.</li>
</ol>
It’s like an "<i>Iron Man suit</i>": AI helps, but a human is still the smart driver!
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How will companies and coders change their work with new AI tools?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content">The way companies and people make computer programs will change a lot:
<ol>
    <li><b>Faster Building:</b> AI tools mean teams can build more programs, or build them faster, making everyone more productive.</li>
    <li><b>New "Programmers":</b> Since "<i>programming in English</i>" is possible, more people who don't know traditional code can now help make software. This means new kinds of job roles!</li>
    <li><b>New Products:</b> Companies will create "<i>partial autonomy apps</i>"—tools where AI helps with parts of the job, but humans are still in control. Think of it like a smart assistant for everything!</li>
</ol>
It's an exciting time to build new things.</div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-4">AI Brains: How They Work, Their Quirks, and What's Next
</h2>
    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>How can we use smart but sometimes silly AI safely for important jobs?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><ol>
  <li><i>AI sometimes acts super smart, but also makes silly mistakes, like saying 9 is bigger than 10. This is called <b>"jagged intelligence"</b>.</i></li>
  <li><i>And sometimes, AI just makes stuff up, like telling a made-up story or fact. This is called <b>"hallucinating"</b>.</i></li>
  <li><i>To use AI for important jobs like helping doctors or banks, we need to make sure it's always right and safe.</i></li>
  <li><i>We do this by having humans always check the AI's work, like a superhero team! Humans and AI work together, with AI doing the first draft and humans making sure it's perfect. This is called a <b>"human-in-the-loop"</b> system.</i></li>
  <li><i>We also use special buttons or controls (like an <b>"autonomy slider"</b>) to decide how much the AI can do on its own, and give it easy-to-see pictures (a <b>"GUI"</b>) so humans can quickly see if the AI did a good job or not. We also teach AI to only do small steps, like keeping it on a <b>"leash"</b>.</i></li>
</ol>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What magic makes AI brains run fast on our own little computers?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><ol>
  <li><i>Imagine computers in the 1960s were super big and expensive, like a huge factory! Many people had to share one, taking turns to use it. This sharing was like <b>"time-sharing"</b>.</i></li>
  <li><i>Now, big AI brains (<b>LLMs</b>) are a bit like that big, expensive computer. They mostly live in big cloud centers far away, and we connect to them over the internet, sharing their power.</i></li>
  <li><i>To have a <b>"personal computing revolution"</b> for AI, like when everyone got their own small computer, we need AI brains to become much smaller and cheaper to run.</i></li>
  <li><i>This means we need new ways to make them fit on our phones or laptops, run super fast without needing the internet all the time, and use much less power. It's like finding a way to shrink a huge factory into a tiny toy that still works great!</i></li>
</ol>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How can we help AI brains remember everything forever, not just for a little while?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><ol>
  <li><i>Right now, AI brains (<b>LLMs</b>) are a bit like Dory from "Finding Nemo" or the people in "Memento". They forget things they just learned after a short time, especially when you start a new chat. This is like having <b>"anterograde amnesia"</b> – they can't make new lasting memories easily.</i></li>
  <li><i>Their current short-term memory is called the <b>"context window"</b>, like a little notepad they use for one conversation. When the conversation ends, the notepad is wiped clean.</i></li>
  <li><i>Even with some new ideas for <b>"long-term memory"</b>, the AI still doesn't "learn" and "grow" smarter on its own like people do over time.</i></li>
  <li><i>To fix this, smart scientists need to invent totally new ways that AI brains are built (<b>"fundamental architectural shifts"</b>). Imagine if Dory could suddenly remember everything she learned yesterday! This would let AI truly learn, get better every day, and become super experts all by themselves.</i></li>
</ol></div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-4">Iron Man Suits: How Smart Can Our Computers Get?
</h2>
    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>How do we show how much control AI has, so you trust it?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><ol>
  <li><b>"Autonomy sliders"</b> are like a magic dial! You turn it to choose how much your computer friend helps you, from a little to a lot.</li>
  <li>To show what the computer is doing (its <b>"agency"</b>), apps need clear pictures and easy buttons. Think of it like a car showing you what it sees on the road.</li>
  <li>To keep your <b>"trust"</b>, the computer should let you easily check its work and say "yes" or "no" to what it suggests. It's like having a helpful friend, but you're still the boss!</li>
</ol>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If smart computers mess up, who's in trouble?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><ol>
  <li>When computers become "Iron Man Suits" that help themselves (called <b>"autonomous agents"</b>), it's like they're driving their own car!</li>
  <li>If a regular tool breaks, it's usually the person using it who is <b>"accountable"</b> (gets the blame).</li>
  <li>But if the smart computer makes a mistake, like driving the wrong way, new <b>"rules"</b> (legal and ethical frameworks) are needed to decide who is responsible. Is it the person, the company who made it, or both? It's a big puzzle to solve!</li>
</ol>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Where's it hardest for computers to help, and how can we check their work fast?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><ol>
  <li>It's super hard for computers to help all by themselves in important jobs like writing big computer programs or teaching kids. That's where <b>"human verification loops"</b> are super important!</li>
  <li>These loops mean a human needs to quickly check what the computer did, like checking if it drew the right picture or wrote the right words.</li>
  <li>To make these checks super <b>"fast and reliable"</b>, we need clever tools like easy-to-see pictures (<b>"GUIs"</b>) and ways to tell the computer exactly what to do so it doesn't get carried away!</li>

      <li>
        <strong>If AI helps everyone code, what new jobs will people do?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content">If "<b>vibe coding</b>" means talking to computers in regular words to make them do things, then building computer programs becomes much easier!
<ol>
  <li><b>Old Jobs Change</b>: People who used to write super tricky code might do different kinds of jobs.</li>
  <li><b>New Jobs Appear</b>: They could become "<b>AI trainers</b>" (teaching the AI what to do) or "<b>AI supervisors</b>" (checking the AI's work to make sure it's good and safe).</li>
  <li><b>New Skills</b>: We'll need to be good at giving clear instructions to AI and understanding how it thinks, like being a good team leader for a smart robot!</li>
</ol>

      <li>
        <strong>How can websites be easier and safer for AI helper robots to use?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content">For AI helper robots to play nicely with websites, we need some new rules!
<ol>
  <li><b>Robot-Friendly Maps</b>: Instead of just pretty pictures for humans, websites need special "<b>robot maps</b>" or instruction books. These tell AI exactly what everything is and how to use it, like a treasure map for robots.</li>
  <li><b>Secret Handshakes</b>: We need better "<b>web protocols</b>" (like secret rules for how computers talk). These will be like special "<b>secret handshakes</b>" to make sure only good AI agents can do things, keeping everything "<b>seamless</b>" (smooth and easy) and "<b>secure</b>" (safe from bad robots).</li>
